# WP Empty Theme

"Empty" WordPress theme for testing a barebones WordPress site, as a reference point to compare actual themes and plugins to.

The theme includes only the bare minimum requirements to work:
* a single PHP template file
* a single inline stylesheet for WP-required style directives
* minimum required theme support
* no JavaScript
* no menus, no widget areas, etc.
