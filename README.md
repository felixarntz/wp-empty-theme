# WP Empty Theme

"Empty" WordPress theme for testing a barebones WordPress site, as a reference point to compare actual themes and plugins to.

Based on a completely stripped-down [Twenty Twenty-One](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/).

The theme includes only the bare minimum requirements to work:
* only the 1 minimum template file:
    * `index.php`
* only 3 minimum template parts:
    * `header.php`
    * `footer.php`
    * `comments.php`
    * `searchform.php`
* a single inline stylesheet for WP-required style directives
* minimum required theme support
* no JavaScript
* no menus, no widget areas, etc.
